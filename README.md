# Proctoring-system
It is a python program, along with Google's media pipe libraries.
Various schools, colleges face the problem of using a large number of personnel to proctor the students manually failing to ensure continuous integrity and security aspects of the examination. These results encouraging examinees to use unethical methods to score more in exams and falsely grading the knowledge and ability of a student. Also, in general, in online examinations, a human cannot proctor at large scales,
effectively.
Thus, we are trying to create a proctoring system which can monitor at scale and ensure that examinees don't practice cheating or other types of unethical behaviours.
